Have ping-data for each node inside hr and ls folders (Pingall experiment):

1) nfd-cdf-med.sh
2) get-rtt-cdfs.sh
3) plot-rtt-cdfs.sh

Failure experiment:

1) convergedata.sh
2) plot-converge-csu.sh

Failure experiment with time as x axis:

1) convergedata-bytime.sh
2) plot-convergence-bytime-csu.sh

% Packet Loss (% Timeout)

1) timeout-percentage.sh (does everything - modified combination of nfd-cdf-med.sh + combine-med.sh + plot-med.sh)
2) get-timeout-cdfs.sh
3) plot-timeout-cdfs.sh

Sorted Timeout %

1) timeout-percentage-sorted.sh
   will have to tweak what exactly you want to plot, currently plotting 4 faces

Counting Messages:

1) ndndump-count-msgs.sh
   -->total results stored in face-$/msgs.count
   -->node results stored in node.msgs

-----------------------------------------------
Does not currently apply, was to be used such that it creates a new folder each time you run it inside the dir to store processed info.
But I don't have those changes any longer in 4-get-failure-stretch.sh since we use a different wrapper now (create-stretch-graphs)
Moved to old files for the moment
Failure stretch:

1) failure-stretch-wrapper.sh (might have to tweak plot-failure-stretch for multiple failure experiment)
   --> Don't worry about the divide by zero error
